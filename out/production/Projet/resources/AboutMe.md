# Functional Programming Project

Author : _SIMONEAU Antoine_
Version: 1.0

## How to run
Just run the *Main* file.

## Features
### Read:
- Read a data by its id
- Read all data

### Add:
- Add a data with a specific id to the memory


### Delete:
- Delete a data by its id
- Wipe memory

### Memory:
- Show the memory status (bytes free / bytes available)

### AboutMe:
- Display the AboutMe.md doc (the one you're reading)

### Exit:

## Technical specifications
- File:  SIMONEAU_Antoine_HEI5_2022_Scala.zip
- Memory file name: memory.txt

## Details
When the project is packaged it can't write the memory file because I did not succeed to use the file as a resource (read works). That's why I recommend running the project into an IDE like IntelliJ.
